        The first gesture of an architect is to draw a perimeter; in other
        words, to separate the microclimate from the macro space outside. This
        in itself is a sacred act. Architecture in itself conveys this idea of
        limiting space. It’s a limit between the finite and the infinite. From
        this point of view, all architecture is sacred.
